INTRO - Binary Vectors
======================
A Boolean function in m variables is a mapping from Fm 2
into F2. For example, for m = 2, the following mapping 
defines a Boolean function f :

 (0, 0) → 0
 (1, 0) → 1
 (0, 1) → 0
 (1, 1) → 0

Question4: 
==========
A function taking as input a truthtable (as an array of 
ints), and returning its Hamming weight.

The Hamming weight of a Boolean function is the number of 
ones in the binary truth table

The Hamming distance between two Boolean functions is the 
Hamming weight of their sum (note that the truthtable of 
the sum of two Boolean functions is the sum of the 
truthtables of these functions). In other words, it is 
equal to the cardinal of the set

Question5:
==========
A function hamming_distance(f1,f2) returning an int 
(the prototype in C would/could be 
int hamming_distance(int f1[], int f2[], int m))


Question6:
==========
A function in m variables is said to be balanced if it 
takes values 0 and 1 the same number of times. What is 
the Hamming weight of such a Boolean function? Implement 
a function is_balanced(f) which checks the balancedness 
of a Boolean function f
