INTRO - Binary Vectors
======================
u >> i = (ui, ui+1 , . . . , um−1, 0, . . . )
u&v = (u0 ∗ v0 , . . . , um−1 ∗ vm−1)

For example, to get the first bit (u0 ) of an integer 
u, we can write u&1. Similarly, (u >> i)&1 gives the 
i-th bit (ui) of u

Question1: 
==========
A function taking as inputs an integer u (viewed as 
a binary vector) and an integer i, which returns the 
i-th bit of u.

Question2:
==========
A function returning the indice of the first non-zero 
bit of a binary vector.

Question3:
==========
A function that implements the Hamming weight of a 
binary vector
