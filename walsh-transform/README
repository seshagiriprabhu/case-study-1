INTRO - Walsh Theorm
====================
The Walsh transform fˆ of a Boolean function f is the 
mapping which associates to a vector a ∈ F2^m the 
quantity

Question7: 
==========
A function which computes the scalar product between two 
vectors of F2 given as integers

Question8:
==========
For e ∈ F2, (−1)e is the sign function, with (−1)0 = 1 
and (−1)1 = −1. Implement this function (int sign(int e) 
in C).

Question9:
==========
a function which computes the Walsh transform fˆ(a) of a 
Boolean function f (given as a truthtable) at point a ∈ 
F2 m. Write a function which computes fˆ(a) for all 
a ∈ Fm 2 (it can return an array of size 2m containing 
all the values). What is its complexity?
