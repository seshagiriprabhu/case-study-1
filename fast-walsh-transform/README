INTRO - Fast Walsh Theorm
=========================
It is easy to do a Fast Walsh Transform by hand.  (Well, I say
"easy," then always struggle when I actually do it.)  Let's do the
FWT of function f: (0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0):  First note that f has a binary
power length, as required.  Next, each pair of elements is modified
by an "in-place butterfly"; that is, the values in each pair produce
two results which replace the original pair, wherever they were
originally located.  The left result will be the two values added;
the right will be the first less the second.  That is,

Question11:
==========
A function which implements Fast walsh algorithm.

Question12:
===========
The complexity of Fast Walsh algo is O(nlogn)

Question13:
==========
a function which computes the Walsh transform fˆ(a) of a 
Boolean function f (given as a truthtable) at point a ∈ 
F2 m. Write a function which computes fˆ(a) for all 
a ∈ Fm 2 (it can return an array of size 2m containing 
all the values). What is its complexity?
